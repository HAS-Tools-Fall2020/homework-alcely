2. **What codes and/or data are associated with this paper? Provide any link to the codes and datasets and a 1-2 sentence summary of what was included with the paper (i.e. was it a github repo? A python package?A database? Where was it stored and how?)**
The paper includes a github repo, with the ERgene python package, installation instructions, examples in jupyter notebook and data in csv files ([github link]( https://github.com/Starlitnightly/ERgene)).

3. **Summarize your experience trying to understand the repo: Was their readme helpful? How was their organization? What about documentation within the code itself?**
The readme was simple and easy to follow. I wished more information about the folder contents in the readme file. Some folders name are not so intuitive. The code have few comments.

4. **Summarize your experience trying to work with their repo: What happened? Where you successful? Why or why not?**
It was very easy to run the jupyter notebooks: the example and orignal code. I think that was easy because they shared the entire github repo and applying jupyter notebooks makes things easier for new users.

5. **Summarize your experience working with the data associated with this research. Could you access the data? Where was it? Did it have a DOI? What format was it in?**
The data are in csv files included in the github repo.

6. **Did this experience teach you anything about your own repo or projects? Things you might start or stop doing?**
Some insights:
 - Some journals require to publicate your research code, so do it nicely.
 - Comments and instructions need to be documented.
 - folder names and directory organization are highly relevant.
 - jupyter codes are recommend for publications.
 - **Finally, it wasn't easy to find an article in Python with non-permissions requirements.**

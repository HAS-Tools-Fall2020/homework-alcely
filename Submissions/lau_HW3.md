## Assignment 3: Forecast week 3
**Name: Alcely Lau**

**Date: 09/13/2020**

#### Assignment summary

This year **2020** the streamflow behavior of Verde River has broken record. It established a new weekly average streamflow minimum. I would not recommend to use only the historical streamflow data for a forecast. However, that is what we have, for now. So, I did an educated guess playing with python.

For this week I followed the next steps:

1. Download the stream gauge observations from the USGS NWIS website, [mapper](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/).

- Explore the data using the Starter Code Python file.

- Take a look at the historical and 2020 streamflow values. By simple visual inspection, for the period from 1 July to 5 September 2020, I would say that the streamflows probably are more similar to the streamflows for the same period of the years **2011** and **2019**. Unlike to the first week I eliminated the year **2009**.

#### Assignment questions

1. Describe the variables `flow`, `year`, `month`, and `day`. What type of objects are they, what are they composed of, and how long are they?
2. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?
3. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)
4. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?

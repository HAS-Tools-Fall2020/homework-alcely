For the first forecast I followed the next steps:

- Download the stream gauge observations from the USGS NWIS website.

- Import the data into Excel.

- Take a look at the historical and 2020 streamflow values. By simple visual inspection, for the period from 1 July to 30 August 2020, the streamflows could probably are more similar to the streamflows for the same period of the years 2009, 2011, and 2019. Hence, for the weekly forecast, I used the average value of 2 weeks (the previous and the current weeks) of the years 2009, 2011, and 2019.  

## Grade

## Assignment 2: Forecast week 2
**Name: Alcely Lau**

**Date: 09/06/2020**

For the second forecast week I followed the next steps:

- Download the stream gauge observations from the USGS NWIS website.

- Explore the data using the Starter Code Python file.

- Take a look at the historical and 2020 streamflow values. By simple visual inspection, for the period from 1 July to 5 September 2020, I would say that the streamflows probably are more similar to the streamflows for the same period of the years **2011** and **2019**. Unlike to the first week I eliminated the year **2009**.

## Grade
3/3 - Nice job!
